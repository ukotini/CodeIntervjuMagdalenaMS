# Read me

Temporary repo for my intervju. The code is written in ADA for a real time system project, Fall 2024. 
This code will not run at all without this repo: https://github.com/aiunderstand/Ada_Drivers_Library/tree/master and an ADA compiler. 
However, the code was also altered locally when I was working on the project, so this code will not run without those changes. 

# The code is in these files:
mycontroller_empty.adb -> This is the body file 
mycontroller_empty.ads -> This is the spesification file
