# Read me

Temporary repo for my interview. The code is written in Ada for a real-time system project, Fall 2024.
This code will not run at all without this repo: [Ada_Drivers_Library](https://github.com/aiunderstand/Ada_Drivers_Library/tree/master)  and an Ada compiler.
However, the code was also altered locally when I was working on the project, so this code will not run without those changes.

# The code is in these files:

mycontroller_empty.adb → This is the body file

mycontroller_empty.ads → This is the specification file
